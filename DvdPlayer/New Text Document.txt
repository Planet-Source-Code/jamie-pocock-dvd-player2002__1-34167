If you are having problems running this app

You need to register dvdnav.ocx
To do this put dvdnav.ocx into your c:\windows\system directory

Then get my app reg it on planet source to register the ocx

Now you may have to go into your Project menu and click components to add my nav control.

Then place it on the form named ShapedForm over the black horizontal line near the bottom

It should work now.


DVD player, more features than any other I have seen on the planet to date and looks much better, this is a very good example of playing DVD's with VB, it started as an app to be published as shareware, but I got bored. So it is now open source. It is in no way finished but is fully functional.
